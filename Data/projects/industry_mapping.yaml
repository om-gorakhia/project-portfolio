key: industry-mapping
title: Leads to Industry Mapping Model
summary: Classifies entities into hierarchical industry categories using keyword layers and AI fallback.
objectives:
  - Standardize industry assignments across multiple datasets
  - Reduce manual effort and improve mapping accuracy
  - Handle ambiguous/unmatched entities using AI-based classification
  - Support hierarchical industry classification (Sector → Sub-sector → Industry)

pipeline:
  - name: Data Ingestion
    details:
      - Excel/CSV lists, CRM extracts, internal databases as input sources
      - Initial preprocessing - remove nulls, normalize text (case, whitespace, special characters)
      - Load into staging area for mapping
  - name: Preprocessing & Standardization
    details:
      - Standardize company/entity names using base CN actions (trim, clean, lowercase, propercase)
      - Normalize common abbreviations and variations (Ltd. = Limited)
      - Flag entities with missing key information for downstream handling
  - name: Keyword Matching Layer (Primary Mapping)
    details:
      - Exact Match - entity names/descriptions matched directly with industry master keywords
      - Partial/Substring Match - detect if entity names contain key industry-related terms
      - Fuzzy Matching - Levenshtein distance for spelling errors
      - Synonym/Alias Mapping - alternate terms (Apparel = Clothing)
      - Weighted Multi-Keyword Matching - score and aggregate keyword hits
  - name: Hierarchical Mapping
    details:
      - Assign entities to industry hierarchy after initial keyword matching
      - Level 1 - Sector (Technology, Healthcare)
      - Level 2 - Sub-sector (Software, Biotech)
      - Level 3 - Industry (SaaS, Pharmaceuticals)
      - Ensure all assignments respect parent-child relationships
  - name: AI Integration (Fallback)
    details:
      - Send entities failing keyword/fuzzy matching to AI-based classification
      - Train on historical entity-to-industry mappings
      - Generate predicted industry labels with confidence scores
      - Flag low-confidence predictions for RPA or human validation
  - name: Consolidation & Validation
    details:
      - Combine results from keyword matching and AI predictions
      - Only one industry per entity unless multi-industry assignment allowed
      - Check parent-level consistency (Level 3 aligns with Level 2 and Level 1)
      - Flag confidence scores below threshold for review
  - name: Output Generation
    details:
      - Generate master industry-mapping file
      - Include Entity_ID, Entity_Name, Sector, Sub_sector, Industry
      - Add Mapping_Flag, Confidence_Score, Mapping_Source, Last_Updated, Remarks
  - name: Automation & Maintenance
    details:
      - Integrate pipeline with PowerApps for UI and batch updates
      - Periodically retrain AI model with newly validated mappings
      - Maintain logging for each step including unmatched entities and AI predictions
tools:
  - Python (pandas, fuzzy matching)
  - PowerApps / AI Builder
  - SQL / Local DB
  - Excel/CSV
impact:
  - Efficiency - Manual effort reduced by >80%
  - Accuracy - Improved classification across diverse entity types
  - Scalability & Resiliency - AI fallback + hierarchy rules
  - Knowledge Capture - Feed mappings into AI retraining and synonym updates
