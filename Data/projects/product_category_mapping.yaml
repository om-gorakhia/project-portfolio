title: Product–Category Mapping Model
summary: Automates product-to-category mapping using multi-stage keyword matching, AI fallback, and RPA for exceptions.
objectives:
  - Standardize product-to-category assignments across datasets
  - Reduce manual intervention and improve accuracy
  - Ensure 100% coverage with AI/RPA fallback
  - Create scalable pipeline for diverse input sources
tags: [NLP, Mapping, AI, RPA, Data-Engineering]
pipeline:
  - name: Data Ingestion
    details:
      - Excel/CSV files from business units, API feeds, PowerApps submissions
      - Initial cleaning - remove nulls, trim whitespace, standardize case, normalize special characters
      - Load data into staging area for processing
  - name: Preprocessing & Standardization
    details:
      - Standardize product names using base CN actions (clean, trim, propercase, lowercase)
      - Apply normalization rules for abbreviations, typos, synonyms
      - Flag incomplete or ambiguous entries for further processing
  - name: Keyword Matching Layer (Primary Mapping)
    details:
      - Exact Match - direct comparison of product names to category keywords
      - Fuzzy Matching - Levenshtein distance for minor spelling variations
      - Partial/Substring Matching - identify products containing category keywords
      - Synonym Mapping - leverage synonym dictionary (laptop = notebook)
      - Weighted Multi-Keyword Matching - score based on keyword frequency and hits
  - name: AI Integration via PowerApps
    details:
      - Send unmatched products to AI-powered categorization module
      - Azure AI/Power Platform AI Builder predictions with confidence scores
      - Continuous training on historical product-category pairs
      - Low-confidence predictions flagged for manual review
  - name: RPA Bot for Exception Handling
    details:
      - Triggered when AI confidence below threshold or verification needed
      - Search internal databases/knowledge bases for product information
      - Cross-reference historical mappings, update staging table
      - Flag for human validation, ensure 100% coverage
  - name: Consolidation & Validation
    details:
      - Merge results from keyword matching, AI predictions, RPA outputs
      - Apply validation rules - one product per category, respect hierarchies
      - Category levels (Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3) validation
      - Flag confidence scores below threshold for manual audit
  - name: Master File Generation
    details:
      - Generate standardized master product-category mapping file
      - Include Product_ID, Product_Name, Category levels, Mapping_Flag
      - Add Confidence_Score, Mapping_Source, Last_Updated, Remarks
  - name: Automation & Maintenance
    details:
      - Schedule entire pipeline for batch runs via PowerApps/Power Automate
      - Periodic AI model retraining using newly validated mappings
      - Maintain logging and audit trails for pipeline execution and errors
tools:
  - Python (pandas, fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz)
  - SQL/Local DB
  - PowerApps / AI Builder
  - UiPath / Power Automate
  - Excel/CSV
impact:
  - Automation Efficiency - Reduced manual mapping by over 85%
  - Accuracy Improvement - Multi-layer approach across datasets
  - Scalability & Resiliency - AI+RPA fallback ensured coverage
  - Knowledge Capture - Generated datasets for continuous improvement
