key: no-code-rule-framework
title: No-Code Query & Rule Framework & Scoring & QC Module
summary: Enables non-technical users to define extraction, scoring, and QC rules without code, with accuracy and relevance scoring.
objectives:
  - Enable dynamic lead scoring with user-defined no-code rules
  - Standardize accuracy checks and modular QC actions
  - Evaluate relevance via context, recency, and activeness
  - Provide transparent, scalable, low-maintenance data pipelines
tags: [No-Code, Rule Engine, Scoring, QC, Data-Engineering]
pipeline:
  - name: Rule Definition & No-Code Input
    details:
      - UI for defining datapoint, class type, entities, operators, aggregation, score
  - name: QC / CN Module (Preprocessing & Cleaning)
    details:
      - Trim, lowercase, propercase, dedupe, null-fill, split/merge, symbol removal
  - name: Rule Execution & Condition Matching
    details:
      - Sequential rule parsing, AND/OR/List evaluation, score assignment
  - name: Accuracy Scoring
    details:
      - Compare expected vs. actual SOW datapoints, compute Accuracy_Score
  - name: Relevance Scoring
    details:
      - Polarity, recency, activeness factors → weighted Relevance_Score
  - name: Lead Scoring Calculation
    details:
      - Combine Accuracy, Relevance, user rules → final Lead_Score
  - name: Consolidation & Output
    details:
      - Log Matched_Rules, QC_Flags, Accuracy, Relevance, Lead_Score, timestamps
  - name: Export & Integration
    details:
      - Outputs to CSV, dashboards, downstream systems
tools:
  - Python (pandas, custom rule engine)
  - SQL / Local DB
  - PowerApps / No-Code UI
  - Excel / CSV
impact:
  - Empowered non-technical users to build scoring logic
  - Standardized QC and scoring across datasets
  - Improved lead prioritization and data quality
