title: GMS (Gross Merchandise Sales) Model
summary: Dynamically segments e-commerce markets and performs revenue estimation across platforms via automated ingestion, ML clustering, and scoring.
objectives:
  - Ingest and standardize multi-platform e-commerce data
  - Automate feature engineering for segmentation metrics
  - Apply ML clustering (K-Means, hierarchical) with dynamic weighting
  - Deliver end-to-end orchestrated pipeline in n8n
